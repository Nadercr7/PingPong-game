# PingPong-game
This Python program uses the Turtle module to create a simple two-player Ping Pong game. It sets up a graphical window with two paddles and a ball. Players can control the paddles using the 'W', 'S' keys for Player 1, and the arrow keys for Player 2. The ball bounces off the walls and paddles, and when it crosses either side, the score is updated.
